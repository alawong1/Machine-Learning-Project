    "<p>Determining whether someone will be able to pay their statements on time by their due date given their previous history of credit card payments. Of course, the most important factors taken into consideration would be the account balance that they would have held and the status of their bill. Other factors taken into consideration will be, for example, their education, their age, etc. The approach to determining whether or not a given person will default is a binary classification.</p>\n",
    "<p>For the house price dataset, details and features of a home such as: square footage, the number of bathrooms and bedrooms are provided to predict the price of that house. Owning a home is a costly expenditure, and it is ideal to purchase a home when the housing market is in an acceptable state. Thus, we want to predict the future value of that house in the event that the house needs to be sold with regression."
